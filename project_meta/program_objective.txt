Primary Objectives
------------------
1. Retrieve hour data from a local SQL Server database in JSON format.
2. Log in to the e-boekhouden website.
3. Fetch existing hour data for a financial year (default the current year) from e-boekhouden.
4. Compare the data between the database and e-boekhouden:
   4.1. Add: Insert new hours present in the database but not in e-boekhouden.
   4.2. Update: Modify hours in e-boekhouden if they differ from the database.
   4.3. Refresh: After all hours have been added, updated or deleted, we'll check if the changes are reflected in e-boekhouden.
   4.4. Sync Error: 
      - Orphaned Events: Events in e-boekhouden without event_id that do not exist in the database will be logged. 
      - Conflict events: Events that exist in both the database and e-boekhouden with matching event_id will be 
         - updated in e-boekhouden, database is leading.
         - not updated in e-boekhouden and the database when the event is invoiced.
            - It will be logged
      - Conflict e-boekhouden base data 
         - When one of these dropdowns do not match any of the values we're inserting from the database, log the error to the log file. The dropdowns are:
            - Employee (medewerker)
            - Project (project)
            - Activity (activiteit)
         - The event cannot be inserted into e-boekhouden if the dropdowns do not match any of the values we're inserting from the database.
   4.5. Events are identified between the database and e-boekhouden by the event_id.
      - The event_id is a GUID of an event in the database.
      - When inserting an event into e-boekhouden, the event_id is stored in the description field (opmerkingen).
         - It will always be the last line in the description field.
         - It will be formatted as: "[event_id: <event_id>]"
            - The event_id is used to identify the event in the database.
   4.6. Logging any sync error event will be logged in the log file.
         - It will contain:
            - All data fields we can fetch from e-boekhouden.
            - The date of the error.
            - The error message.
5. Ensure invoiced hours in e-boekhouden are prohibited from being modified or deleted in either the database or e-boekhouden.
6. Log all actions and errors for review.
7. Execute locally and support scheduling (e.g., cron or Windows Task Scheduler). 
8. The user should be notified of any sync errors or other errors from the log file via email.
